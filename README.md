# FlightGear custom scenery of Buenos Aires area 

This scenery covers some parts of the Buenos Aires province area (in the tile w060s40) and is generated using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data.

The process exctracts landcover information from the OSM datasets (landuse, natural, water tags, etc) and uses [Osm2City](https://osm2city.readthedocs.io/) for line data and objects (roads, tracks, rivers, buildings, pylons, etc.)

## How to use

Clone or download and unzip, then add the folder as a scenery folder in FlightGear.

**IMPORTANT**: The `Details` folder must be renamed or linked to `Obejcts`. If you already have an `Objects` folder, copy the contents of `Details` into it.

#### From command line

Use the `--fg-scenery` option:
```
fgfs --aircraft=ufo --airport=SADF --fg-scenery=/home/julio/repos/scenery-6040
```
*replace `/home/julio/repos/scenery-6040` with the location of this folder in your computer*

#### Startup Script

Add it to your .fgfsrc script, normally located in your home directory or folder:
```
...
--fg-scenery=/home/julio/src/scenery/osm-2018/auto/output/
...
```

#### Launcher
If you use the FlightGear gui launcher, add the folder into `Add-ons->Additional scenery folders` using the Add(+) button on the right.  **DO NOT** use the `Install add-on scenery` button! That button its intended for scenery *packages*, not folders. 

## Contributing
As stated before, I use OpenStreetMap data to generate the scenery, so, if you want to contribute all you need to do is edit the information there (in OSM) and it will be included in the next run.

The most important information is landcover (residential, industrial, and commercial areas, forests, parks, ponds, etc.) and buildings.
